# React Login Form

A simple React project featuring a login form with TypeScript, Axios, and integration with Material UI. The project includes GitHub Actions for code quality checks using ESLint and Prettier.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly login form in React, ensuring type safety, proper validation, and integration with Material UI components. The application utilizes TypeScript for enhanced type checking, Axios for handling HTTP requests, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration.

## Technology Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Material UI
- React Hook Form
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Functional Requirements

The login form should include the following features:

- Two input fields: email and password.
- Validation for both fields:
  - Email: Must be in a valid email format.
  - Password: Implement basic requirements, e.g., minimum length.
- Upon form submission, type-safe values should be displayed in the console or on the screen.

## Technical Requirements

- Use Create React App for the project structure.
- Implement TypeScript for type safety.
- Utilize Axios for handling HTTP requests.
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated code quality checks.
- Set up ESLint and Prettier for code consistency.
- Use React Hook Form for form management.
- Utilize Material UI components for the user interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
